            <p>To evaluate your refinancing options accurately, follow these simple steps:</p>

                    Enter Current Loan Details: Provide your outstanding loan balance, current interest rate, and the number of years remaining on your mortgage.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add Cash Out (Optional): If you plan to borrow extra money, enter the amount in the "Cash Out" field. This will be added to your new loan balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select Closing Cost Option: Use the checkbox to specify whether you will pay closing costs upfront or roll them into the new loan amount.

                <li>
                    Analyze Your Results: The calculator will instantly display your new monthly payment, potential savings, break-even point, and a comparison of total interest paid.

            <h2>Understanding Your Refinance Results</h2>
             <p>Your results provide a clear financial comparison to help you make an informed decision:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New Monthly Payment: The new principal and interest payment for your refinanced loan.</li>
                <li>Monthly Savings: The immediate difference between your old and new monthly payments. A positive number indicates savings.</li>
                <li>Break-Even Point: The number of months it will take for your accumulated monthly savings to cover the closing costs of the refinance. This is a critical metric for deciding if the refinance is worthwhile.</li>
                <li>Lifetime Savings: The total amount of money you will save (or lose) in interest payments over the entire life of the new loan compared to your current one.</li>
<li>Visual Charts: Interactive charts that illustrate the difference in your loan balance payoff over time and compare the total interest you'll pay for each loan.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
                <details>
                    <summary>Q1: When is a good time to refinance?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        A1: Homeowners typically refinance to secure a lower interest rate, which can reduce monthly payments and total interest costs. Other reasons include switching from an adjustable-rate to a fixed-rate mortgage, shortening the loan term to pay it off faster, or cashing out home equity for large expenses.
                    </div>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Q2: What is a 'break-even point'?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        A2: The break-even point is the moment when the money you've saved from a lower monthly payment equals the amount you paid in closing costs. If you plan to stay in your home longer than the break-even period, the refinance is generally considered financially beneficial.
                    </div>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Q3: What are closing costs?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        A3: Closing costs are fees charged by the lender and third parties to process your refinance loan. They can include appraisal fees, title insurance, attorney fees, and loan origination fees, and typically range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount.
                    </div>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Q4: What is a 'cash-out' refinance?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        A4: A cash-out refinance allows you to take out a new, larger mortgage than what you currently owe and receive the difference in cash. It's a way to to tap into your home's equity to fund things like home improvements, debt consolidation, or other major purchases.
                    </div>
                </details>
                 <details>
                    <summary>Q5: Does this calculator guarantee my new loan terms?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        A5: No. This calculator provides a reliable estimate based on the numbers you provide. Your final loan terms, interest rate, and approval are subject to a formal underwriting process from a lender, which includes verifying your credit score, income, and property value.
